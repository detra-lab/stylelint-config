- [SCSS Config] Removed the deprecated `scss/at-import-no-partial-leading-underscore` rule. It has been replaced by the `scss/load-no-partial-leading-underscore` rule [(more details)](https://github.com/stylelint-scss/stylelint-scss/blob/master/src/rules/at-import-no-partial-leading-underscore/README.md).
